Suites can be grouped or nested by registering them using a file path.

E.g. if we register two suites as "foo/alpha" and "foo/beta" we will end up with
two suites which will appear in the cylc-run directory as:

cylc-run/
 `- foo/
     |- alpha/
     `- beta/

The cylc-run and rose-run bash scripts show how to achive this the cylc way
and the rose way.
